## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/form-builder.git
   cd form-builder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the environment:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Run the application locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build and deploy with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Innovation**: Utilizes cutting-edge libraries like React DnD for an enhanced user experience.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle future expansions with modular architecture.
- **Tailored for Fiyge**: Showcases skills aligned with Fiyge's expectations and standards.
